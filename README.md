# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-Narrative

# 2. Algorithms and Data Structures â€“ 3DTriangleOpenGL Narrative

# Overview
This narrative details the enhancements made to the 3D Pyramid rendering program developed using C++ and OpenGL. The focus was on applying object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, improving buffer management, and ensuring error handling during shader compilation.

# Key Enhancements
Modular Buffer Management: Introduced a Buffer class for streamlined resource handling.
Dynamic Object Handling: Used std::vector to manage multiple objects efficiently.
Improved Error Handling: Enhanced shader compilation error detection and reporting.
Optimized Matrix Operations: Integrated the GLM library for matrix transformations.

# Reflection
The narrative highlights the challenges of working with real-time graphics and how improvements in data structures and error handling contributed to better performance and maintainability. It demonstrates proficiency in OOP principles and the practical application of computer graphics algorithms.
